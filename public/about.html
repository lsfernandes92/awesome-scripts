        <p>
          This website contains scripts that aim to *automate* tasks and set shortcuts whether for productivity or fun.
          <br>
          <br>
          These scripts are like *executables* that you can run from the terminal by typing the script name.
          <br>
          <br>
          To make things easier, here, the terms *script* and *executable* mean the same thing.
          <br>

          <h2>>_ What's a script?</h2>
          <blockquote>
            It's a file containing a series of terminal *commands* that your shell can execute.

          <h2>>_ What's a shell? Which is the most common?</h2>
          <blockquote>
            It's a software that *interprets* terminal commands. 
            </br>
            You can use multiple shells.
            </br>
            Each has its own characteristics. 
            </br>
            The most common shell is *bash*.

          <h2>>_ What's bash? What are the pros?</h2>
          <blockquote>
            Stands for *bourne again shell*.
            </br>
            A software to interpret terminal commands. 
            </br>
            It's also an extended version of the *unix bourne shell (sh)*.
            </br>
            </br>
            The pros of using bash are:
            </br>
            (+) *Popularity*
            </br>
            (+) *Default* shell in many Linux distros

          <h2>>_ What's the shebang at the beginning of a file?</h2>
          <blockquote>
            It's commonly used in script files. 
            </br>
            It starts with *#!*.
            </br>
            And it tells the system which *interpreter* to use.

          <h2>>_ Which shebang should you use?</h2>
          <blockquote>
            Although, I see the shebang line more as an *indication* for the user who will run the script.
            </br>
            </br>
            I recommend using `#!/usr/bin/env <INTERPRETER>` because it's portable.
            </br>
            The *env* command exists on Unix-like systems.
            </br>
            It's a utility program that manages environment variables, finds and execute programs using $PATH.
            </br>
            It depends on your *$PATH*.
            </br>
            </br>
            Alternatively, use the fixed path `#!/bin/bash` when you need the system bash and want to avoid $PATH manipulation.
            </br>
            This works on both MacOS and Linux.

          <h2>>_ Where to store system-wide scripts?</h2>
          <blockquote>
            I recommend that you use `/usr/local/bin/` because it's the most common location for executables that aren't managed by your package manager.
            </br>
            Additionally, it's in the default $PATH.
            </br>
            </br>
            Alternatively, for user-specific scripts use `~/.local/bin` (you may need to add this to your $PATH).
            </br>
            </br>
            You can also store it somewhere else and symlink to `/usr/local/bin/`.
            </br>
            In the end, it's totally up to your *preferences*.

          <h2>>_ When using rbenv, can I store my script in the shim folder?</h2>
          <blockquote>
            You can do that, but I don't recommend it.
            </br>
            Each ruby version managed by rbenv has its own `<PATH_TO_SHIM_DIR>/bin` folder, so a script might not be available for your current ruby version unless you set it up.

          </br>

          <h2>>_ Can I save my scripts without file extension?</h2>
          <blockquote>
            Yes, the file extension it's purely informational.
            </br>
            Actually, the *shebang* at the beginning of a file is what determines which interpreter to use.

          <h2>>_ So, this is basicaly a commandlinefu.com clone?</h2>
          <blockquote>
            Yes!
            </br>
            I didn’t even know this existed before I made this.
